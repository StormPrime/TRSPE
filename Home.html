<p1>The reason i chose to do a twitter profile to represent Calypso is because it sounded fun after I had the idea to code an actual fake twitter profile for Calypso. I had two real choices if I wanted to code it, a twitter profile or a digital stats sheet. Shortly after I came up with the idea I realized there weren't really much details about her other than the fact she thought that Odysseus was her one and true love, Which intern made me decide on doing a twitter profile. The reason I wanted to code it is because I haven't coded anything in a while and I figured it would be a nice opportunity to get some practice</p1>
